if |a| is greater than |b| and a is -ve, it won't be prime
if n(n+a) is a multiple of b, it won't be prime
if a is odd and b is even, it will always be even
if a is even and b is odd, n(n+a) + b will be odd for even values of n
if a is even and b is even,  n(n+a) + b will be odd for odd values of n.
if a is odd and b is odd, n(n+a) + b will always be odd

1. Begin with a=999, b=999, n=0
2. Evaluate n^2 + an + b.
3. If it is -ve:
	- store a, b and n
	- decrease b by 1
	- set a to 999
	- go back to step 2
4. If it is even and greater than 2:
	- store a, b and n
	- decrease a by 1
	- go back to step 2
5. If it is prime:
	-increase n by 1
	-go back to step 2
6. Otherwise:
	-store a,b, and n
	-decrease a by 1
	-go back to step 2
