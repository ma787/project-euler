When going up the triangle from the nth number of a given row:
you can only go up to the nth or the (n-1)th number of the row above

the opposite is true for going down (i.e. can only go to nth or (n+1)th)

the problem is reducible if you work out the maximum path in a 2-rowed triangle, e.g.:

 5
6 7

you can replace this with the maximum path (12)

   7
  4 5
 6 9 10

becomes

   7
 13 15

which becomes 22
