step 1:

1. Multiply the numerator by 10 until it is bigger than the denominator.
2. Store the numerator in a list.
2. Divide the numerator by the denominator, finding the quotient and the remainder.
3. If the remainder is 0, stop (the decimal is terminating).
4. If the remainder is in the list of numerators, stop.
5. Store the quotient.
6. Set the remainder as the new numerator and go back to step 1.
