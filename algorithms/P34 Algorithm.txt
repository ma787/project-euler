An x-digit number made up entirely of 9's is the largest x-digit number.

If you find a value of x such that the sum of the factorials of the digits
is less than x-digits long, that is a limit for a curious number
(i.e. there are no curious numbers equal to or greater than that number)

For example, if x was 7:
9! + 9! + 9! + 9! + 9! + 9! + 9!
would have to be a 6-digit number or less
