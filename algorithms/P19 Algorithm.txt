1. Start with the day of the week on 1 Jan 1901. Assign it a value – n – from 1-7 corresponding to the day (e.g. Monday → 1)
2.	
•	If the year is a century and it is divisible by 400, February has 29 days.
•	If the year is not a century and it is divisible by 4, February has 29 days.
•	Otherwise, February has 28 days
3. If n is a multiple of 7, the first day of the month is a Sunday. Add this to a running total.
4. Add (the number of days of the month - 28) to n and move on to the next month.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for the rest of the months in the year.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for every year up to 2000 (inclusive).
7. Output the running total.
