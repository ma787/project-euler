1. Find the smallest number with over 500 divisors.
2. Solve the equation: 0.5n^2 +0.5n â€“ x = 0, where x is the number.
3. If n is an integer, go to step 5.
4. Round n up to an integer.
5. Evaluate 0.5*n*(n+1) to get a triangular number.
6. Find the number of divisors of this number.
7. If it has more than 500 divisors, go to step 10.
8. Add (n+1) to the nth triangular number.
9. Go to step 6.
10. The triangular number that you have is the first with over 500 divisors. Output the number.
