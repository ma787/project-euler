1. Start with a = 10 and b = 11.
2. Check if the last digit of a is equal to the first digit of b.
3. Take this digit away from both a and b to create c and d, respectively.
4. If b = 0, then skip to step 6.
5. If a/b = c/d, add a/b to the list of curious fractions.
6. If a = 98, go to step 8.
7. If b = 99, increase a by 1 and set b as a+1.
8. Multiply the numerators of all the fractions by each other.
9. Multiply the denominators of all the fractions by each other.
10. Find the gcd of the two products.
11. Divide the denominator by the gcd to get it in its simplest form.
