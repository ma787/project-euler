If un is even, un+1 = n/2

If un is odd, un+1 = 3n + 1

If un is odd, then un+1 must be even

If the last two digits of un , when divided by 2, give an odd number, then un+1 must be odd.

To get the longest chain you need to maximise the number of odd numbers.

If un  = 2x, un+x = 1


1. The lengths of the Collatz sequences for 1 and 2 are 4 and 2, respectively. These are stored in a list of lengths.
2. n is the starting value of the sequence (begin with n=3).
